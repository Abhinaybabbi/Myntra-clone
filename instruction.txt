Images to be hosted on s3, image description to come from dynamo db. When a user clicks on the image, record the click. Show a static page. 


1- You can use online apis but make sure that you first dump all the product details to you db and then make a call to your database and lookup for the items. Using s3 would be the bonus point.
2- Authentication is not needed but just in case you do it and maintain record at user level it would definitely a bonus point.
3- on click of add to cart button record the product name, quantity added to the cart. Also show the number of click on the add to cart button.
